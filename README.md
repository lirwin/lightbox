Simple lightbox UI dialog

Instructions

Below these instructions are five paragraphs, each of which contains a thumbnail image. Write HTML, Javascript, and CSS so that clicking on an image will open its larger constituent image in a lightbox-style "dialog" box. For example, the first image is represented by the thumbnail imgs/img-1-thumb.jpg. Clicking that image should open a modal dialog box that displays the larger version of the image, imgs/img-1.jpg, on the order of what's seen in the examples section here. Obviously the solution should work for all five of the images. The dialog box should display on top of all other elements on this page, and you should include at least one mechanism so that the dialog can be easily closed. Bonus points will be awarded for graying out the content underneath the dialog when it's open, so that while the dialog is displayed, no operations can be performed aside from the ones housed within the dialog. Please do not use any jQuery plugins to complete this exercise.
